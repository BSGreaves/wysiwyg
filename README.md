# What You See Is What You Get

## Description

In this Nashville Software School assignment, we were asked to create a simple page to display an array of cards, each with a different famous person (I chose World War 2 generals).

## Usage

Task: Create an array of objects that represents famous people.
1. When you click on one of the person elements, a dotted border should appear around it.
1. When you click on one of the person elements, the text input should immediately gain focus so that you can start typing.
1. When there is a highlighted person element, and you begin typing in the input box, the person's biography should be immediately bound to what you are typing, letter by letter.
1. When you press the enter/return key when typing in the input field, then the content of the input field should immediately be blank. (Works as a way to edit and save information in the bio).
